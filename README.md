## What is Cryptography ?

Cryptography is process that is use for protect information from Un-authorize access.
</br>

## Types of Crypto

i. Symmetric-key cryptography

ii. Asymmetic-key Cryptography

iii. Hash-function Cryptography
</br>

### Symmetric Crypto:

Symmetric cryptography is type of cryptography

where both sender and receiver use same private key .
</br>

### types of Symmetric Crypto

Classical :

i. Substitution Cipher

ii. Transposition Cipher

Substitutions Cipher:

I .Caesar cipher

ii. Mono-alphabetic Cipher

iii. Poly-alphabetic Cipher

### Basic Term Of Cryptography

Symmetric Cryptography:

a. Caesar Cipher

b.Rot13

c.Vigenere Cipher

d.Morse code

e.Bacon Cipher

f.Alphabetical substitution
</br>


# Tools:
a. Cyberchef

b.Caesar Cipher

c.Vigenere Solver

How to solve Symmetric Crypto

Symmetric Crypto:

Step 1 : Use cipher identify for identifying the type of cipher

Step 2 : Use recommendation cipher tools for solving the problem

Step 3 : If the cipher is symbolic cipher ,try to identify the symbolic type using

given below tools :https://www.dcode.fr/symbols-ciphers

Step 4 :If problem is not solving via above steps check step 5

Step 5 : Read problem description carefully and try to solve it manually

### Hash Function Cryptography


#### What is Hash Function Cryptography?

A cryptographic hash function is an algorithm that takes an arbitrary amount of data input—a credential—and produces a fixed-size output of enciphered text called a hash value, or just “hash.”

### Basic Term Of Cryptography

How Detect Hash Function:

a.Md5 ------------ 32 digits

b.SHA-1 ------------- 40 digits

### Process :

a. Hashid / Haiti /Hash Analizer

b.Online tools

c.John the ripper

## Asymmetric Encryption

Asymmetric Encryption
is a cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys. Each
pair consists of a public key (which may be known to
others) and a private key (which may not be known by
anyone except the owner).

### Asymmetric Encryption

openssl

By default installed in kali

If not then

## sudo apt-get install openssl

Generate a private Key

=> openssl genrsa –out private.pem 2048

From private key generate public key

=> openssl rsa --in private.pem --out public.pem --outform
PEM –pubout

## To encrypt any file:

=> openssl rsautl –encrypt –inkey public.pem –pubin –in [file
to encrypt] –out [encrypted file name]

## To decrypt any file:

=> openssl rsautl --decrypt --inkey private.pem --in enc.txt --out 3.txt
